# P3R-UIM
UIM Blender importer/exporter for P3R. UIM flipbook filetype. UIM's are in charge of some 2d vector animations (like the water in menu for instance). The UIM's are split up into multiple files, each one being it's own frame. Though the UIM does seem to have data for compacting the animation into one file, along with various things like uvs, and vertex color animations. As of right now I just tested the menu UIM's to make sure they import/export correctly and they do.

To install hit code --> download zip --> install the .zip in as a blender plugin through the addons page in Blender's settings.
